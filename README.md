# Task Manager Demo

This repository contains a very small demo of a task manager. Open `index.html` in a browser to see a simple interface for managing projects and weekly tasks.

The demo stores data in memory and will lose changes on refresh. It implements:

- A header with the title "Task Manager".
- A collapsible settings section for adding projects.
- A weekly task section with an 8 column grid (task + Monday to Sunday).
- Week navigation to view previous and next weeks.
- Each task row includes archive and delete buttons.
- A form to add new weekly tasks.
- Clickable day icons to mark completion of tasks for a given date.

Other features mentioned in the spec are not fully implemented.
