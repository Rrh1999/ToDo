# Caddyfile for ToDo app behind HTTPS
# Replace example.com with your real domain or use localhost for local HTTPS

todostuff.duckdns.org {
  encode zstd gzip
  # Simplest and most reliable: proxy everything to the Node app
  reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:3000

# For local testing with a cert you trust via Caddy, you can also use:
# localhost {
#   encode zstd gzip
#   reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:3000
